**Tags**: [architecture, feedback-loops, system-design, real-world-testing]

## Context

We received unprecedented real-world feedback from two different implementation scenarios that revealed critical insights about our system design:

1. **Update Process Feedback**: A successful v1.0 → v2.0 update taking 6.5 minutes with 100% data preservation
2. **From-Scratch Setup Feedback**: Fresh installation revealing system-breaking reliability issues

**Key Architectural Insight**: The system's design should incorporate feedback loops from real-world usage to drive continuous improvement, rather than relying solely on theoretical design principles.

**Critical Discovery**: Different failure modes exist for different use cases:
- **Setup failures**: TOML syntax, bash arithmetic, template expansion
- **Update failures**: File truncation, case logic errors, backward compatibility
- **Success patterns**: Systematic approaches, validation steps, data preservation

## Decision

We will adopt "Real-World Feedback Integration" as a core architectural principle:

1. **Feedback-Driven Design**: System architecture should anticipate and incorporate mechanisms for capturing real-world usage patterns and failure modes

2. **Dual-Path Validation**: Design must account for both fresh installations and upgrade scenarios as distinct architectural challenges

3. **Self-Improving System**: The system should use its own decision-tracking capabilities to capture and learn from implementation experiences

4. **Proactive Reliability**: Rather than reactive bug fixes, build reliability measures based on actual observed failure patterns

5. **Documentation Evolution**: System documentation should evolve based on real user experiences, not just theoretical completeness

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Dramatically improved reliability** through proactive failure mode prevention
- **Better user experience** based on actual usage patterns rather than assumptions
- **Continuous improvement cycle** where real-world usage drives system evolution
- **Reduced support burden** through prevention of common issues
- **Enhanced system maturity** through battle-tested design patterns

### Neutral:
- Requires ongoing attention to user feedback and issue reports
- System complexity increases to handle multiple failure modes
- Documentation maintenance becomes more involved

### Negative:
- May slow initial development as we account for more scenarios
- Risk of over-engineering solutions to rare edge cases

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Testing Approach**: Rely on unit tests and theoretical validation
   - Rejected: Our real-world feedback revealed issues that theoretical testing missed

2. **Reactive Bug Fixing**: Address issues as they're reported
   - Rejected: The from-scratch setup showed this leads to system-breaking issues

3. **Single-Path Design**: Optimize for either setup or updates, not both
   - Rejected: Both scenarios provide important value and have different requirements

4. **Static Documentation**: Maintain documentation based on design specs only
   - Rejected: Real usage revealed documentation gaps that theory couldn't predict
