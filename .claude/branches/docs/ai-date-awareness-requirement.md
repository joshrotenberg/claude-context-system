# ADR: ai-date-awareness-requirement

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Author**: Claude Context System Team
**Tags**: [docs, ai-optimization, accuracy]

## Context

During testing of the Context Ingestion Speed Test framework, we discovered a critical issue: AI assistants frequently use incorrect dates when creating timestamps, ADRs, and other dated content. This creates several problems:

- **Inaccurate Historical Records**: ADRs and timestamps that don't reflect actual creation dates
- **Broken Timeline Tracking**: Decision history appears out of sequence
- **User Confusion**: Dates that don't match reality undermine trust in the system
- **Testing Inconsistencies**: Speed test results with wrong dates reduce credibility

The AI Assistant Quick Start section needs to explicitly address date awareness as a foundational requirement before any other work begins.

## Decision

We will add **date checking as Step 0** in the AI Assistant Quick Start section with explicit instructions to:

**Immediate Requirements:**
- Always check current date/time before proceeding with any work
- Use date/time tools to get accurate timestamps
- Never assume or guess dates for any content creation
- Validate date accuracy before creating ADRs, test results, or reports

**Implementation:**
- Add "Check Current Date First" as Step 0 in Quick Start sequence
- Include date awareness in the "Current Development Phase" context
- Make date checking a prerequisite before other orientation steps
- Emphasize importance with clear formatting and positioning

**Rationale:**
- Date accuracy is fundamental to architectural decision tracking
- Historical context depends on accurate timelines
- User trust requires consistent, accurate information
- Testing and validation need correct timestamps

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Accurate Historical Records**: All ADRs and decisions properly timestamped
- **Reliable Timeline Tracking**: Decision evolution can be traced accurately
- **Improved User Trust**: Consistent, verifiable dates throughout system
- **Better Testing**: Speed tests and reports reflect actual timing
- **Professional Quality**: System maintains high standards for accuracy
- **Future-Proofed**: Establishes pattern for all AI assistant interactions

**Negative:**
- **Additional Step**: Adds one more requirement to onboarding process
- **Tool Dependency**: Requires AI assistants to have date/time tool access
- **Potential Friction**: Could slow down immediate task execution
- **Enforcement Challenge**: No automatic validation of date accuracy

**Risk Mitigations:**
- Place date checking as Step 0 to establish it as foundational
- Use clear, prominent formatting to ensure visibility
- Provide specific instructions about using date/time tools
- Include date accuracy in validation checklists

## Alternatives Considered

**Automatic date injection**: Build date checking into helper scripts
- *Rejected:* Doesn't address AI-generated content outside scripts

**Date validation in commit hooks**: Check dates during git operations
- *Rejected:* Too late in process, doesn't prevent initial errors

**Optional date checking**: Make it a suggestion rather than requirement
- *Rejected:* Critical accuracy issue requires mandatory approach

**Post-creation date correction**: Fix dates after content is created
- *Rejected:* Creates extra work and potential for missed corrections

**Ignore the issue**: Accept that some dates may be incorrect
- *Rejected:* Undermines system credibility and user trust

## Success Metrics

**Immediate (1 week):**
- Date checking instruction added to Quick Start section
- All new ADRs use correct dates
- Test results show accurate timestamps

**Short-term (1 month):**
- No incorrect dates in system-generated content
- User feedback confirms improved accuracy
- Testing framework shows consistent timing

**Long-term (3-6 months):**
- Date accuracy becomes standard practice
- Other projects adopt similar date awareness requirements
- System demonstrates reliable historical tracking
