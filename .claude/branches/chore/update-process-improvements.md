**Author**: Claude Context System Team
**Tags**: [update-process, retrospective, reliability, automation]

## Context

A successful v1.0 → v2.0 update process provided valuable retrospective insights that complement our from-scratch setup findings. The update took 6.5 minutes and achieved 100% data preservation while adding significant new capabilities, but revealed specific update-process issues distinct from setup problems:

**Update-Specific Issues Discovered**:
1. **Syntax Error Recovery**: Script truncation during large file edits requiring 2 minutes of debugging
2. **Case Statement Logic Errors**: Wildcard patterns catching commands before specific cases
3. **Missing Update Features**: No automated backup, incremental updates, or version compatibility checking
4. **Large File Edit Risks**: Complete file replacements are risky and hard to validate

**Success Metrics Achieved**:
- Zero data loss (6/6 existing ADRs preserved)
- All new features functional immediately
- 9 external branches detected by new scan functionality
- Enhanced safety with authorization framework

## Decision

We will implement update process improvements based on this retrospective analysis:

1. **Pre-Update Safety Measures**:
   - Automated backup creation before any file modifications
   - Syntax validation (`bash -n`) before script deployment
   - Version compatibility checking to prevent unsafe transitions

2. **Update Process Optimization**:
   - Break large file edits into smaller, testable chunks
   - Implement file completeness verification after edits
   - Establish optimal update sequence: Documentation → Configuration → Scripts → Validation

3. **Enhanced Error Recovery**:
   - Add rollback capability for failed updates
   - Self-diagnostic functionality in helper script
   - Troubleshooting suggestions in validation commands

4. **Incremental Update Support**:
   - Detect what's changed and update incrementally
   - Avoid all-or-nothing replacement approach
   - Support partial updates for minor version changes

5. **Process Documentation**:
   - Update order best practices
   - Common error patterns and resolutions
   - Time estimates and performance metrics

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Dramatically improved update reliability** with automated backup and validation
- **Faster error recovery** with rollback capabilities and better diagnostics
- **Reduced update friction** through incremental updates and validation
- **Better process documentation** enables consistent successful updates
- **Risk mitigation** for large file operations and syntax errors

### Neutral:
- Slight increase in update process complexity and time
- Additional backup files and validation steps
- Need to maintain update tooling alongside core system

### Negative:
- Minimal - these prevent update failures and data loss

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Update Process**: Continue with current manual approach
   - Rejected: The retrospective showed clear automation opportunities

2. **External Update Tools**: Use git-based or package manager approaches
   - Rejected: Violates zero-dependency principle and adds complexity

3. **Version Lock**: Prevent updates to avoid process complexity
   - Rejected: System evolution is essential for continued value

4. **Complete Rewrite Each Time**: Always start fresh rather than update
   - Rejected: Would lose valuable existing ADRs and project context
