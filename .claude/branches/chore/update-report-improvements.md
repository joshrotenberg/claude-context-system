**Author**: Claude Context System Team
**Tags**: [enhancement, tooling, date-awareness, user-experience]

## Context

We received valuable feedback from a real-world update process where an older version of the Claude Context System was updated to v2.0. The update report revealed several areas where our system could be improved to provide better user experience, especially for AI assistants getting oriented on projects for the first time.

Key issues identified:
- Lack of clear AI assistant onboarding sequence
- Missing date awareness requirements (critical for timestamp accuracy)
- Limited helper script functionality compared to what users expect
- Need for better maintenance tracking and overdue alerts

## Decision

We will implement the following improvements to our Claude Context System:

1. **Add AI Assistant Quick Start Section**: Include a prominent section at the top of the system documentation with step-by-step orientation for AI assistants, emphasizing date checking as the first step.

2. **Enhance Helper Script Commands**: Add new commands based on the update report:
   - `check-due` - Show overdue maintenance items with current date awareness
   - `status-brief` - Quick project status summary
   - `context-update` - Manual context refresh with timestamp updates
   - `scan` - Check for external changes (simplified version)
   - `priorities` - Show current priorities and focus areas

3. **Implement Date Awareness Requirements**: Add a critical section requiring AI assistants to always check the current date before proceeding with any work.

4. **Upgrade System Version**: Update metadata to reflect v2.0 enhanced capabilities.

5. **Improve Quick Reference**: Add a comprehensive quick reference card with essential commands.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Better AI assistant onboarding reduces confusion and improves consistency
- Date awareness prevents timestamp errors in ADRs and maintenance tracking
- Enhanced helper script provides more useful tooling for users
- Version upgrade reflects the improved capabilities
- Quick reference makes the system more accessible to new users

### Neutral:
- Slight increase in documentation length
- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing installations

### Negative:
- Minimal - these are additive improvements that don't break existing functionality

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Incremental Updates**: Could have implemented these one at a time
   - Rejected: The update report showed these work better as a cohesive package

2. **Major Version Jump**: Could have gone to v3.0
   - Rejected: These are enhancements to v1.0 functionality, not breaking changes

3. **Separate Enhancement Document**: Could have documented improvements elsewhere
   - Rejected: Better to integrate improvements directly into the system
