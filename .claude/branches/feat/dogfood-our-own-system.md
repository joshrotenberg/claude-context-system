# ADR: dogfood-our-own-system

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Author**: Claude Context System Team
**Tags**: [dogfooding, meta, self-referential, v1.0]

## Context

We've just completed the Claude Context System v1.0 with a successful automated simulation that proved the system works. The simulation created realistic ADRs in feature branches, but now we face a choice:

Should we actually USE our own system to manage the ongoing development of the Claude Context System itself?

This would create a self-referential development loop where:
- The top-level `CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` remains the canonical product
- The `.claude/` directory manages our own architectural decisions about the system
- Every future enhancement or change gets documented using the system we built
- Users can see authentic, ongoing usage patterns

This is the ultimate dogfooding opportunity.

## Decision

We will **actively use the Claude Context System to manage its own development** going forward:

**Structure:**
- `CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` = The product (single-file distribution)
- `.claude/` = Our project management using our own system
- All future architectural decisions about the system get captured as ADRs
- Maintain both simulation ADRs (proof of concept) and real development ADRs

**Process:**
- Any enhancement, feature addition, or architectural change gets an ADR
- Use conventional commit structure with ADR references
- Let the system manage its own decision history and evolution
- Provide living examples for users to reference

**Self-Referential Benefits:**
- Continuous validation that the system actually works long-term
- Authentic usage patterns for users to study
- Meta-documentation showing how we make decisions about decision documentation
- Proves the system can handle its own complexity

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Ultimate proof of concept - we literally depend on our own system
- Living documentation that evolves with real decisions
- Authentic examples of ADR patterns for users to reference
- Continuous real-world testing and validation
- Self-improving feedback loop: use system → discover improvements → document → enhance
- Users gain confidence seeing creators actively use their own tool
- Meta-level validation of the AI-first approach

**Negative:**
- Risk of infinite recursion if we over-document the documentation process
- Potential confusion between "system ADRs" and "simulation ADRs"
- Added overhead of maintaining our own context while developing
- Possible complexity creep as we document every small decision

**Mitigations:**
- Focus on architectural decisions, not every tiny change
- Clear distinction between product (top-level) and process (.claude/)
- Regular reviews to prevent over-documentation
- Use the system's own guidance about what merits an ADR

## Alternatives Considered

**Simulation only:** Keep .claude/ as proof-of-concept artifacts only
- *Rejected:* Misses opportunity for ongoing validation and authentic examples

**Traditional development:** No .claude/ directory, develop like any other project
- *Rejected:* Would be hypocritical and miss dogfooding benefits

**Separate repository:** Manage system development in different repo with different tools
- *Rejected:* Creates artificial separation and reduces authenticity

**Documentation-only ADRs:** Document decisions but don't use full system workflow
- *Rejected:* Defeats purpose of proving complete system viability
