# Claude Context System: Complete Setup & Guide

**A self-contained, AI-managed system for maintaining project context and architectural decisions. You focus on coding, your AI assistant handles the rest.**

## üéØ The Promise: AI Does the Work, You Stay Focused

**For Developers:**
- Write code and make decisions normally
- Your AI assistant automatically tracks everything
- Never lose context between sessions
- Skip documentation busywork

**For AI Assistants:**
- Complete project context in every session
- Architectural decision history and reasoning
- Current work status and priorities
- Permission-aware automation

**For Teams:**
- Shared understanding across all sessions
- Safe collaboration without workflow disruption
- Decision traceability without overhead

## üîÑ Canonical Reference & Updates

**üìç Canonical Location**: https://gist.github.com/joshrotenberg/a9f8ac85b9ebe20c6b6202a17d804fbc

This document is maintained in the above gist as the **canonical reference**. You should periodically check for updates and implement them as appropriate for your project.

### Automated Update Checking

To stay current with improvements, ask your AI assistant:

```
"Check the canonical Claude Context System gist at https://gist.github.com/joshrotenberg/a9f8ac85b9ebe20c6b6202a17d804fbc 
for any updates since [last-check-date]. Compare it with our current .claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md 
and present a summary of new or changed functionality. Ask if I want to implement these changes."
```

**Recommended check frequency**: Monthly, or before major project milestones.

### Version Tracking

- **Current version**: v2.0 - Enhanced with Authorization & Multi-Developer Support
- **Last local update**: 2025-07-18
- **Next recommended check**: 2025-08-18

## The Problem This Solves (2-Minute Pitch)

### The Problem We're Solving

- **"Why did we choose X?"** - Asked 6 months later, nobody remembers
- **"What did the last person try?"** - Context lost when team members change
- **"What should our AI assistant know?"** - Inconsistent recommendations across sessions
- **"Where did we leave off?"** - AI agents lose context between sessions, leading to repeated mistakes
- **"Will this break my team's workflow?"** - Non-users shouldn't be hindered by the system
- **"Can I trust it with git operations?"** - Unauthorized automation can be disruptive
- **Technical debt from undocumented decisions** - Costs compound over time

### The Solution: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

A lightweight system that:
- Takes 5 minutes to set up
- Requires ~10 minutes per major decision
- Saves hours of confusion and rework
- Makes AI assistants 10x more helpful
- **Works safely in shared repositories** without disrupting non-users
- **Asks permission** before any git/GitHub operations
- **Detects external changes** and suggests relevant ADRs

### Real ROI Example

**Without ADRs:** 2 hours finding why Redis was chosen over Postgres **With ADRs:** 2 minutes reading `cache-technology-decision.md` **Break-even:** After just 3-4 "why did we..." questions

## Quick Setup (Copy ‚Üí Paste ‚Üí Done)

### 1. Create the Directory Structure

```
mkdir -p .claude/{branches/{feat,docs,chore,arch},merged,templates}
```

### 2. Copy This File

Save this file as `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` in your project root.

### 3. Tell Claude

"Please read `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` and set up the complete system for our project."

That's it! Claude will create all the files, templates, and scripts needed.

### 4. Set Up Update Checking (Recommended)

Add a reminder to check for system updates:

```
"Remind me to check the canonical Claude Context System gist 
(https://gist.github.com/joshrotenberg/a9f8ac85b9ebe20c6b6202a17d804fbc) 
for updates next month and implement any improvements."
```

## üöÄ You're Looking at an AI-First System

**IMPORTANT: This document looks comprehensive because your AI assistant manages all of it.** You don't need to learn or maintain any of this manually.

### How It Actually Works:
1. **You:** "Let's use PostgreSQL instead of Redis for caching"
2. **AI:** Creates ADR, updates context, tracks implementation  
3. **You:** Keep coding while AI handles documentation

### Three Weeks Later:
1. **You:** "Why did we choose PostgreSQL for caching?"
2. **AI:** "ADR #7 from Jan 15th: Redis caused memory issues in production, PostgreSQL provides ACID guarantees we needed for transaction caching"
3. **You:** Get answer instantly, keep working

### The Files Are Human-Readable But AI-Managed
- **Markdown/TOML** format so you CAN read them
- **AI assistant** maintains them so you DON'T HAVE TO
- **Git-friendly** so teams can collaborate
- **Zero external dependencies** so it works everywhere

**The rest of this document is your AI assistant's manual, not yours.**

## Built on Proven Foundations

This system combines two foundational practices in modern software development:

### ü§ù Conventional Commits + Architectural Decision Records

**Conventional Commits** - A specification for standardized commit messages that enable automated tooling and clear communication. Created by the open-source community and inspired by Angular's commit guidelines, it provides structure for `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` and other commit types.

**Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** - Introduced by Michael Nygard in 2011, ADRs capture the context, decision, and consequences of architecturally significant choices. They solve the "why did we choose X?" problem that plagues every software project.

### üöÄ Our Innovation: Unified Context System

We've merged these practices into something new:
- **Conventional commit structure** for ADR organization and workflow
- **ADR decision tracking** with modern git-native tooling
- **AI assistant integration** that understands both commit history and decision context
- **Self-contained system** that requires no external dependencies
- **üîê Tiered authorization system** for safe git/GitHub operations
- **üë• Multi-developer repository support** with passive monitoring
- **üîç Smart change detection** that suggests ADRs for external decisions

This creates a decision management system that's both lightweight and powerful - perfect for teams using AI assistants in their development workflow.

**Credits**: Huge thanks to Michael Nygard for ADRs and the Conventional Commits community for commit standardization. This system builds on their foundational work.

## üóìÔ∏è CRITICAL: AI Assistant Date Awareness

**AI Assistant: ALWAYS start every session with:**

1. **Check current date first** - Never assume dates
2. Read `.claude/adr-index.toml` [updates] section  
3. Compare current date with `next_due_*` fields
4. Alert user to any overdue maintenance
5. Provide context update if due

**Never assume dates - always check current date first!**

## AI Assistant Integration

### For Claude/AI Assistants

When working with this project:
- **Always read the ADR index first** to understand current decisions and authorization settings
- **Check permission settings** before suggesting git/GitHub operations
- **Respect authorization levels** - never override user permission preferences
- **Reference specific ADRs** when making recommendations
- **Suggest new ADRs** when major decisions are needed
- **Update ADRs** when decisions change or evolve
- **Maintain consistency** with existing architectural choices
- **Check for system updates** when explicitly asked or monthly
- **Use team features** like `scan` and `suggest` to detect external changes
- **Respect passive mode** in multi-developer environments

### Authorization Guidelines for AI Assistants

**Before any git/GitHub operation:**
1. Check the `[permissions]` section in `adr-index.toml`
2. For "never" - inform user the operation is disabled
3. For "ask" - request explicit permission from user
4. For "yes" - proceed but inform user what you're doing

**Example permission check:**
```
I see you want me to commit these ADR changes. 
Your current setting is 'use_git = "ask"'.
May I proceed with: git add .claude/branches/feat/new-feature.md && git commit -m "Add feature ADR"?
```

### System Update Protocol

When asked to check for updates:
1. Check user's authorization for git operations first
2. Fetch the canonical gist: https://gist.github.com/joshrotenberg/a9f8ac85b9ebe20c6b6202a17d804fbc
3. Compare with local `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md`
4. Identify new features, improvements, or fixes
5. Present summary of changes with benefits/impact
6. Ask user which updates to implement
7. Update local system accordingly (respecting permissions)
8. Update "Last local update" date in this file

### Starting a New AI Session

```
Starting session for [project]. Please:

1. **Check current date first** (what is today's date?)
2. Read .claude/adr-index.toml [updates] section  
3. Compare current date with next_due_* fields
4. Show me any overdue maintenance:
   - System updates overdue?
   - Permission review overdue? 
   - ADR maintenance overdue?
   - Context update overdue?
5. If context update is due/overdue, give me current project status
6. Update last_check_* dates for completed items

Authorization level: [check my permissions for git/GitHub operations]
Team environment: [check if passive_mode is enabled]

Then let's start today's work with current context.
Current focus: [specific area/feature]
Open questions: [list any pending decisions]

If this is a team repository, please run './adr-helper.sh scan' to check for external changes.
```

### Enhanced AI Commands

**Permission-aware operations:**
- `"Check my authorization settings and suggest any changes"`
- `"Scan for external changes in team repository"`
- `"Suggest ADRs based on recent commit patterns"`
- `"Enable safe mode for this repository"`

**Team collaboration:**
- `"Set up this repository for team use"`
- `"Check what changes others have made"`
- `"Suggest ADRs for decisions I might have missed"`

## üîê Authorization & üë• Collaboration Features

### Authorization Framework

The enhanced Claude Context System includes a comprehensive permission system to ensure safe operation in any environment:

#### Permission Levels
- **`never`** - Operation is completely disabled
- **`ask`** - Request permission each time (safest for shared environments)
- **`yes`** - Auto-approve operation (convenient for personal projects)

#### Key Authorization Categories

**Git Operations:**
```toml
[permissions]
use_git = "ask"          # Basic git command permission
auto_commit = "no"       # Automatic commits
auto_push = "no"         # Automatic pushes
```

**GitHub/GitLab Operations:**
```toml
[permissions]
use_gh = "ask"           # GitHub CLI operations
auto_pr = "never"        # Automatic PR creation (usually kept restrictive)
```

**Granular Controls:**
```toml
[permissions.git]
add_files = "ask"        # Stage files
create_branches = "ask"  # Create new branches
merge_branches = "never" # Merge operations (high-impact)
```

### Multi-Developer Repository Support

#### Passive Mode Operation
- **Non-intrusive**: System won't interfere with developers who don't use it
- **Change detection**: Monitors external changes without disrupting workflow
- **Smart suggestions**: Offers ADR creation for detected architectural decisions

#### External Change Detection
```bash
# Daily workflow for team environments
./adr-helper.sh scan     # Check for new branches and commits by others
./adr-helper.sh suggest  # AI analysis of potential decisions in recent commits
```

**Example scan output:**
```
üîç Scanning for external changes...
üìä External Change Summary:

  ‚Ä¢ New branch: feat/payment-gateway by alice@company.com
  ‚Ä¢ New branch: arch/microservices by bob@company.com

üí° Suggestions:
  ‚Ä¢ Consider creating ADR for payment gateway decision
  ‚Ä¢ Consider creating ADR for microservices architecture choice
```

#### Team Configuration
```bash
# One-time setup for team repositories
./adr-helper.sh team-setup
```

This configures:
- Appropriate permission levels based on team size
- External change tracking preferences
- Passive mode for non-disruptive operation
- Branch monitoring patterns

### Safety-First Design

#### Safe Mode
```bash
./adr-helper.sh safe-mode
```

Enables maximum safety settings:
- All git operations require explicit permission
- No automatic commits or pushes
- Passive mode enabled for team compatibility
- External change tracking without interference

#### Permission-Aware AI Operations
AI assistants automatically:
- Check permission settings before suggesting operations
- Respect "never" settings completely
- Request explicit permission for "ask" settings
- Inform users about "yes" operations before executing

### Quick Setup for Different Environments

#### Personal Project (Relaxed permissions)
```bash
./adr-helper.sh permissions
# Set: use_git="yes", auto_commit="ask"
```

#### Small Team (Moderate permissions)
```bash
./adr-helper.sh team-setup
# Choose: small team, enable external tracking
```

#### Large Organization (Strict permissions)
```bash
./adr-helper.sh safe-mode
# Maximum security and team compatibility
```

## Common Objections & Responses

**"We don't have time for more documentation"**

You don't have time NOT to do this. How much time do you waste explaining past decisions?

**"Our codebase is too small/simple"**

Perfect time to start. It scales with your project and prevents future complexity.

**"We use [other documentation system]"**

This complements existing docs. It's specifically for decisions, not general documentation.

**"What if people don't maintain it?"**

The helper scripts make it trivial. Plus, AI assistants will remind you when decisions aren't documented.

**"Will this interfere with my team's workflow?"**

No! The system operates in passive mode by default. Non-users are completely unaffected, while users get enhanced context and decision tracking.

**"I'm worried about unauthorized git operations"**

The authorization framework prevents this. Every operation respects your permission settings, defaulting to "ask" for safety. You can even set "never" for operations you don't want.

**"How do I know what my teammates are working on?"**

The external change detection automatically scans for new branches and commits by others, suggesting relevant ADRs without interfering with their work.

## Team Workflow Integration

### 1. Development Workflow

- Create ADRs in feature branches for major decisions
- Review ADRs as part of code review process
- Merge ADRs when decisions are finalized
- Archive completed ADRs to `merged/` directory

### 2. Decision Process

```
1. Identify decision point
2. Create ADR in appropriate category
3. Document context and alternatives
4. Review with team
5. Update status to "Accepted"
6. Implement decision
7. Update ADR with actual consequences

```

### 3. GitHub PR Template

```
## Related ADRs
- [ ] I've checked for existing ADRs that might be affected
- [ ] New ADR created: [link to ADR file]
- [ ] ADR status updated: [which ADR, what change]

## Decision Impact
- Architecture: [High/Medium/Low/None]
- Security: [High/Medium/Low/None]
- Performance: [High/Medium/Low/None]
```

## Success Metrics

### Week 1

-  System set up
-  First ADR created
-  Team knows it exists

### Month 1

-  5+ ADRs documented
-  Used in at least one technical discussion
-  New team member used it for onboarding

### Month 3

-  Part of regular workflow
-  Prevented at least one repeated discussion
-  AI assistants consistently reference ADRs

## Troubleshooting

**Remember: Your AI assistant should handle most maintenance automatically. If you're manually debugging TOML files or running complex commands, ask your AI to help instead.**

### Common Issues

**ADR validation fails**

```
# Make script executable
chmod +x .claude/adr-helper.sh

# Check file paths in index
./.claude/adr-helper.sh validate
```

**Missing ADR files**

```
# List what should exist vs what does
./.claude/adr-helper.sh status
find .claude/branches -name "*.md"
```

**TOML syntax errors**

```
# Validate TOML syntax (if you have a TOML parser)
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('.claude/adr-index.toml', 'rb'))"
```

### Emergency Recovery

```
# If index is corrupted
cp .claude/adr-index.toml .claude/adr-index.toml.backup

# Find all ADRs
find .claude -name "*.md" -type f

# Validate structure
./.claude/adr-helper.sh validate 2>&1 | grep "ERROR"
```

## Customization for Different Teams

### Small Teams (2-5 people)

- Use fewer categories (just `feat/` and `arch/`)
- Simpler ADR template
- Less formal approval process

### Large Teams (10+ people)

- More detailed templates
- Formal review process
- Integration with issue tracking
- Regular ADR review meetings

### Different Technology Stacks

- **Frontend**: Add UI/UX decision categories
- **Backend**: Focus on data architecture, API design
- **DevOps**: Emphasize deployment, monitoring decisions
- **Product**: Include feature prioritization, user research

## Advanced Features

### ADR Relationships

Track how decisions relate to each other:

```
[relationships.depends_on]
"new-feature" = ["api-architecture", "database-choice"]

[relationships.conflicts_with]
"microservices" = ["monolith-architecture"]

[relationships.supersedes]
"api-v2" = ["api-v1"]
```

### Status Tracking

```
"decision-name" = {
    status = "proposed" | "accepted" | "superseded" | "rejected",
    superseded_by = "new-decision-id",
    # ...
}
```

### Integration with CI/CD

```
# .github/workflows/adr-validation.yml
name: ADR Validation
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate-adrs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Validate ADRs
        run: ./.claude/adr-helper.sh validate
```

## Document Migration and Cleanup

### Automatic Organization

The system includes tools to handle existing documentation:

```bash
# Organize directory structure
./adr-helper.sh organize

# Clean up and organize existing docs
./adr-helper.sh cleanup
```

The `cleanup` command will:
- Move project-specific docs to `docs/` subdirectory
- Identify and optionally remove redundant files
- Create explanatory documentation for the new structure
- Preserve all valuable content in appropriate locations

### Manual Organization Guidelines

**If you have existing documentation:**

1. **ADR-like documents** ‚Üí Move to appropriate `branches/` category
2. **Project context/overview** ‚Üí Move to `docs/project-context.md`
3. **Setup/guide documents** ‚Üí Move to `docs/` with descriptive names
4. **Redundant system guides** ‚Üí Consider removing if superseded
5. **Reference materials** ‚Üí Keep in `docs/` with clear names

**Document naming conventions:**
- ADRs: `kebab-case-description.md` in appropriate `branches/` category
- Supporting docs: `DESCRIPTIVE-NAME.md` in `docs/` subdirectory
- Avoid generic names like `README.md` in favor of specific purposes
