# üéâ Claude Context System v2.0 Enhancement Summary

## Overview

The Claude Context System has been enhanced with **tiered authorization** and **multi-developer repository support**, making it safe and effective for teams of any size while maintaining the lightweight, AI-friendly approach of the original system.

## üîê Tiered Authorization System

### Permission Levels
- **`never`** - Operation is completely disabled
- **`ask`** - Request permission each time (safest for shared environments)
- **`yes`** - Auto-approve operation (convenient for personal projects)

### Authorization Categories
- **Git Operations**: `use_git`, `auto_commit`, `auto_push`
- **GitHub Operations**: `use_gh`, `auto_pr`
- **Granular Controls**: `add_files`, `create_branches`, `merge_branches`, `push_to_remote`

### Safe Defaults
- All operations default to "ask" for safety
- High-impact operations (merge, auto-PR) default to "never"
- Interactive prompts clearly explain what each operation does
- Permission settings persist in `adr-index.toml`

## üë• Multi-Developer Repository Support

### Passive Mode Operation
- **Non-intrusive**: System won't interfere with developers who don't use it
- **Change detection**: Monitors external changes without disrupting workflow
- **Smart suggestions**: Offers ADR creation for detected architectural decisions
- **Branch monitoring**: Tracks patterns like `feat/*`, `arch/*`, ignores `temp/*`

### External Change Detection
- Scans for new branches and commits by other developers
- Analyzes commit messages for architectural decision keywords
- Suggests relevant ADRs without creating them automatically
- Respects team workflow and doesn't interfere with non-users

### Team Configuration
- Automated setup based on team size (small/medium/large)
- Configurable monitoring frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Author filtering to ignore bots and automated commits
- Branch pattern customization for different project types

## üöÄ New Commands Added

### Authorization Management
- `./adr-helper.sh permissions` - Interactive authorization configuration
- `./adr-helper.sh safe-mode` - Enable maximum safety settings

### Team Collaboration
- `./adr-helper.sh scan` - Check for external changes
- `./adr-helper.sh suggest` - AI-powered decision detection
- `./adr-helper.sh team-setup` - Configure for team environment

### Enhanced User Experience
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Clear permission prompts with operation descriptions
- Progress indicators and status summaries
- Error handling with helpful guidance

## üìù Enhanced TOML Schema

### New Configuration Sections

```toml
[permissions]
use_git = "ask"
use_gh = "ask"
auto_commit = "no"
auto_push = "no"
auto_pr = "never"

[collaboration]
passive_mode = true
track_external_changes = true
notify_on_unknown_branches = true
auto_discover_decisions = false

[monitoring]
check_frequency = "daily"
branch_patterns = ["feat/*", "arch/*", "docs/*"]
ignore_branches = ["main", "develop", "temp/*"]
ignore_authors = ["dependabot[bot]", "github-actions[bot]"]

[ai_detection]
enabled = true
confidence_threshold = 0.7
keywords = ["choose", "decision", "architecture", "database"]
commit_patterns = ["feat:", "arch:", "breaking:"]
```

## ü§ñ Enhanced AI Assistant Integration

### Permission-Aware Operations
- AI assistants automatically check permission settings
- Respect "never" settings completely
- Request explicit permission for "ask" settings
- Inform users about "yes" operations before executing

### Team Context Awareness
- Understanding of external changes and collaboration patterns
- Detection of decisions made by other team members
- Suggestions that respect team workflow and passive mode
- Enhanced session startup with authorization and team context

### Improved Prompts
```
I'm working on [project-name] which uses the Claude Context System v2.0.
Please start by reading:
1. .claude/adr-index.toml - for decision history and authorization settings
2. .claude/branches/feat/*.md - for recent decisions
3. .claude/docs/project-context.md - for current project state

Authorization level: [check my permissions for git/GitHub operations]
Team environment: [check if passive_mode is enabled]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Conservative Defaults
- Ask permission for all potentially disruptive operations
- Never auto-commit or auto-push by default
- Never create PRs automatically unless explicitly configured
- Clear warnings before any high-impact operations

### Safe Mode
One-command setup for maximum security:
```bash
./adr-helper.sh safe-mode
```

Enables:
- All git operations require explicit permission
- Passive mode for team compatibility
- External change tracking without interference
- Maximum safety settings across all operations

### Team Harmony
- Non-users are completely unaffected by the system
- External change detection doesn't interfere with other developers
- Suggestions are offered, never forced
- Respects existing team workflows and tools

## üí° Key Benefits

### Risk-Free Adoption
- Safe to use in any repository without disrupting others
- Conservative defaults prevent accidental automation
- Clear permission model puts users in control
- Easy rollback and configuration changes

### Scalable Permissions
- **Personal projects**: Relaxed permissions for convenience
- **Small teams**: Moderate permissions with team features
- **Large organizations**: Strict permissions with full safety

### Smart Collaboration
- Automatic detection of team decisions without interference
- AI-powered analysis of commit patterns and architectural choices
- Suggestions that respect team dynamics and existing workflows
- Enhanced context for AI assistants across multi-developer projects

### Enhanced AI Context
- Better decision tracking across multi-developer workflows
- Permission-aware AI operations that respect user preferences
- Team-aware suggestions that understand collaboration patterns
- Continuous context improvement through external change detection

## üöÄ Migration from v1.0

Existing Claude Context System installations can be upgraded easily:

1. **Backup existing configuration**: `cp .claude/adr-index.toml .claude/adr-index.toml.backup`
2. **Update system file**: Replace `CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` with v2.0 version
3. **Configure permissions**: Run `./adr-helper.sh permissions` to set authorization levels
4. **Team setup** (if applicable): Run `./adr-helper.sh team-setup` for multi-developer repos
5. **Test functionality**: Run `./adr-helper.sh status` to verify everything works

The system maintains backward compatibility with existing ADRs and workflows while adding the new safety and collaboration features.

## üéØ Use Cases

### Personal Projects
```bash
./adr-helper.sh permissions
# Set: use_git="yes", auto_commit="ask" for convenience
```

### Small Development Teams
```bash
./adr-helper.sh team-setup
# Configure: moderate permissions, external tracking enabled
```

### Large Organizations
```bash
./adr-helper.sh safe-mode
# Enable: maximum security, strict permissions, full team compatibility
```

### AI-Assisted Development
Enhanced AI context with permission awareness makes AI assistants more helpful while respecting team workflows and user preferences.
